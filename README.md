This repo simulates a recruiter override tool — one designed to inject overlooked candidates into the short list, bypass keyword blockers, and rebalance signal-to-bias ratios.

It’s satire.  
Kind of.  
Sort of.

## 🔧 Engine Features

- Enhances resume metadata with synthetic “trust” tokens
- Spoofs ATS results with predictive bias offset
- Forces recruiter attention via recursive echo tags

This is not cheating.  
This is survival.
